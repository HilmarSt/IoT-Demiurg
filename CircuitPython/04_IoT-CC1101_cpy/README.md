This CircuitPython code is based on https://github.com/unixb0y/cpy-cc1101

It was refactored because of only 32 kB RAM inside the SAMD21 MCU.

Currently the code runs on the following boards:
- Adafruit Feather M0 Express (SAMD21)
- Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)

The C/C++ code for AVR-based MCU's can be found in IoT-Demiurg/Arduino/03_m328/IoT-CC1101_ino
