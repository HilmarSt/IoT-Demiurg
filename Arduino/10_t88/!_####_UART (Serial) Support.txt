UART (Serial) Support

There is no hardware UART. The core incorporates a built-in software serial named Serial - this uses the analog comparator pins, in order to use the Analog Comparator's interrupt, so that it doesn't conflict with libraries and applications that require PCINTs. TX is defaults to AIN0 (PD6), RX is always AIN1 (PD7). Although it is named Serial, it is still a software implementation, so you cannot send and receive at the same time. The SoftwareSerial library may be used; if it is used at the same time as the built-in software Serial, only one of them can send or receive at a time (if you need to be able to use both at the same time, or send and receive at the same time, you must use a device with a hardware UART).

If running off the internal oscillator (since this chip does not support a crystal), you may need to calibrate it to get the speed close enough to the correct speed for UART communication to work, though as noted above, this is rarely necessary under typical operating conditions. While one should not attempt to particularly high baud rates out of the software serial port, there is also a minimum baud rate as well

Though TX defaults to AIN0, it can be moved to any pin on PORTD using Serial.setTxBit(b) where b is the number in the pin name using Pxn notation (only pins on PORTD are valid, and unless it is set for TX only, AIN1 (PD7) is not valid) (2.0.0+ only - was broken in earlier versions).
